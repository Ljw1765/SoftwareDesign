Code Editor Project

The class files are in \src\Wolverines\.
The project functions are not working.
The file functions (new, open, save, close) are working.
A preview.png image of the editor and test.txt opened is included in this directory.
As far as highlighting keywords and operators, they are only being highlighted when a file containing them are opened.
File > Open > test.txt will produce the preview image.

Sources: Some of the code is borrowed by a Geeksforgeeks tutorial on Java Swing.
